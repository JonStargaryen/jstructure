      <details>Experiments were perfomed at 33 °C in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.3). The total salt concentration was maintained at 2.5 M throughout the range of GdmCl concentrations by addition of NaCl. Values of m and ΔGapp,0ex were calculated by fitting the exchange data at different [GdmCl] to the equation. Fitting was performed only when k(ex) could be measured for more than six [GdmCl].</details>
