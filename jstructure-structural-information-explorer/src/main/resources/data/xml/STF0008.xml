      <details>All experiments were carried out at 5C using a RQF-63 rapid mixing quenched-flow apparatus. Complete denaturation and exchange of the backbone amide protons with deuterium was achieved by dissolving CBTX (20 mg/mL) in 6 M urea-d4 in D2O at pD 2.7. Refolding of denatured protein was initiated by a 11-fold dilution with 50 mM glycine-d5 (pH 3.0) in H2O. At this pH, H/D exchange rate was negligible. After variable refolding times ranging from 9.8 to 500 ms, the solution was diluted again to 11 times of the initial protein volume with 0.2 M sodium borate (pH 9.5) to initiate labeling of the deuterated amides in CBTX with protons.</details>
