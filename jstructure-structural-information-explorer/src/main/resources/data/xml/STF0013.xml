      <details>Equine lysozyme denatured in 6 M GdnHCl was diluted rapidly with deuterated buffer solution at pH 7.5 and 25 °C, in order to initiate simultaneous hydrogen exchange and protein refolding. The intrinsic time constants for amide hydrogen exchange under these conditions are of the order of 10-200 ms. Exchange was allowed to occur for one minute, and was then quenched by decreasing the pH to 4.5.</details>
