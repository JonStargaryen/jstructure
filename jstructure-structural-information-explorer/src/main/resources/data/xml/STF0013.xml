      <details>Equine lysozyme denatured in 6 M GdnHCl was diluted rapidly with deuterated buffer solution at pH 7.5 and 25 째C, in order to initiate simultaneous hydrogen exchange and protein refolding. The intrinsic time constants for amide hydrogen exchange under these conditions are of the order of 10-200 ms. Exchange was allowed to occur for one minute, and was then quenched by decreasing the pH to 4.5.</details>
