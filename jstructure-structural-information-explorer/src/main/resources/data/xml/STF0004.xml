      <details>A solution containing the fully unfolded apo-myoglobin (80 M) at pH 2.2 in HCl/H2O was placed in syringe P. Refolding and H/D exchange was performed at room temperature. The refolding reaction was initiated by a 6-fold dilution of the acid-unfolded apo-myoglobin with either 60 mM acetate buffer or 30 mM citrate buffer in D2O delivered from syringe Q, to a final (uncorrected) pH of 5.8. After refolding times (tf) of 0.4 or 6 ms, the H/D exchange reaction was initiated by a 1/6-fold dilution of the sample solution with D2O buffer containing 350-mM 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1 propanesulfonic acid (CAPS) delivered from syringe R at the desired pH* from 7 to 10.7 to enhance exchange of unprotected amide protons to deuterons. The H/D exchange labeling was allowed to proceed for 3.6 ms.</details>
