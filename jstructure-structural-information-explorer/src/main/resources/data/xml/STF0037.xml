      <details>All experiments were carried out at 5+/-0.1 째C using a RQF-63 rapid mixing quenched-flow apparatus. Complete denaturation and exchange of the backbone amide protons with deuterium was achieved by dissolving CTX III (30 mg/ml) in 6 M deuterated guanidine hydrochloride in D2O at pH 6.6. Deuterated guanidine hydrochloride was obtained through repeated cycles of dissolving ultrapure GdnHCl in D2O followed by repeated lyophilization. Refolding of the denatured protein was initiated by 10-fold dilution with 50 mM glycine-d5 (pH 3.0) in H2O. At this pH, negligible labeling occurred. After variable refolding times ranging from 9.8 to 190.4 ms, the solution was diluted again to 10 times the initial protein volume with 0.2 M sodium borate (pH 9.6) to initiate labeling of the deuterated amides in CTX III with protons. After a lapse of 10 ms, the labeling pulse was stopped by a further 3.4-fold dilution of the initial protein volume with 1 M HCl in water. The final pH was about 3.2, at which the hydrogen/deuterium exchange (for the amides in native CTX III) was minimal.</details>
